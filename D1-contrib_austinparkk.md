Comments:
I actually had a lot of trouble with this deliverable. I actually coded a huge chunk of the PerformQuery and once I was
finished, my partner and I realized that it was too slow so we had to redesign the entire thing to be more performance friendly. 
Next deliverable I will definately figure out all the options and plan out the best way to implement something before actually coding.
