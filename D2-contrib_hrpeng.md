Contribution:   
 * For this deliverable I parsed the information on index.htm, handled the async processes, and called the new function from addDataset

Retrospect:  
 * Through this deliverable I gained a better understanding of async process and promise.   
 * We started early this time but were stuck for quite some time in geoCoding and promise handling (neither turned out to be the problem at the end). The result is good enough.
 * In next deliverable, I should keep the consistancy of my commit to the project and try to do it as well as this one.
