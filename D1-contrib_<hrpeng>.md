For addDataset function, I coded the parts which read from and write to disk, and handled the async processes.  
For performQuery, I completed the validation of query, and coded with my partner the processing of dataset and the returning of results.

Through this deliverable I gained a better understanding of async process and promise.   
The result is not satisfying because both I and my partner are not experienced in coding. We didn't find the best solution at first try and ended up rewriting most of our initial codes, which takes a lot of time.  
In next deliverable, I will discuss with my partner about all the possible ways of completing a task before we split it and start coding.
